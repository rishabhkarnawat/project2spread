# project2spread
A low-latency, event-driven trading research framework that simulates market microstructure, latency-aware signals, and execution-realistic order routing. Uses microprice, order-flow imbalance, and latency-arb–inspired strategies with strict risk controls and structured logging. Built for research and backtesting, not live trading.
